This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Differences from original template:
  1. Uses styled-components and styled-system instead of styled-jsx with some minimal examples of how to use them.
  2. Uses typescript (including eslint config mods, also setting the strict and noimplicitany flags)
